### Playground Project
[![Codeship Status for piotrwitek/react-redux-typescript-guide](https://app.codeship.com/projects/11eb8c10-d117-0135-6c51-26e28af241d2/status?branch=master)](https://app.codeship.com/projects/262359)

You should check Playground Project located in the `/playground` folder. It is a source of all the code examples found in the guide. They are all tested with the most recent version of TypeScript and 3rd party type definitions (like `@types/react` or `@types/react-redux`) to ensure the examples are up-to-date and not broken with updated definitions.
