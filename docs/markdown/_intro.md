# React & Redux in TypeScript - Static Typing Guide
**_"This guide is about to teach you how to leverage [Type Inference](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/type-inference.html), [Generics](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/generics.html) and other [Advanced Types](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/advanced-types.html) as much as possible to write the minimal amount of type annotations needed for your JavaScript code to be completely Type Safe"_** - this will make sure you get all the benefits of Static Typing and your productivity won't be slowed down by adding excess type annotations.

### Goals
- Complete type safety with [`--strict`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/compiler-options.html) flag without failing to `any` type for the best static-typing experience
- Minimize amount of manually writing type declarations by learning to leverage [Type Inference](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/type-inference.html)
- Reduce repetition and complexity of "Redux" type annotations to a minimum with [simple functional utilities](https://github.com/piotrwitek/typesafe-actions#typesafe-actions)

### Playground Project
[![Codeship Status for piotrwitek/react-redux-typescript-guide](https://app.codeship.com/projects/11eb8c10-d117-0135-6c51-26e28af241d2/status?branch=master)](https://app.codeship.com/projects/262359)

You should check Playground Project located in the `/playground` folder. It is a source of all the code examples found in the guide. They are all tested with the most recent version of TypeScript and 3rd party type definitions (like `@types/react` or `@types/react-redux`) to ensure the examples are up-to-date and not broken with updated definitions.
> Playground was created is such a way, that you can simply clone the repository locally and immediately play around on your own to learn all the examples from this guide in a real project environment without the need to create some complicated environment setup by yourself.
